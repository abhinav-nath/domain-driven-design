# Domain Driven Design

## Monolithic Architecture

- Modular
- Huge code bases
- Tight coupling between components
- Teams are composed of multiple smaller teams organized by technology and business
- Changes require coordination between teams
- Spans across multiple business functions

## Microservices Architecture

Arranges an application as a collection of _loosely couple services_. In a microservices architecture, services
are fine-grained and the protocols are light-weight.

MSA helps the business change at a faster pace. In other words, **MSA enables transformation**.

## Business Transformation

Business Transformation is an umbrella term that is used for referring to fundamental changes in how an organization conducts its business.

Example:

- **Microsoft** - from packaged software to subscription model
- **Amazon** - from an online book store to a marketplace
- **Apple** - from computers to iPod, iPhones, iPad, Music Store etc

### Why do businesses transform?

- **Environmental changes** e.g. new regulations
- **Competitive pressure** e.g. rapid rollout of new products
- **New opportunities** e.g. innovative technology
- **Customer demands** e.g. expects immediate response

## Digital Transformation

Digital Transformation is the process of using digital technologies to

1. meet the needs of **transformed business processes**
2. create innovative customer engagement mechanisms

> Digital Transformation supports the Business Transformation initiatives.

**Examples:**

- **Target** - a retail store in the US, till 2011 their website and fulfillment was outsourced to Amazon.
               In 2011, Target decided to transform their business. They invested heavily in digital technologies
               to integrate their supply chain inventories across the partner network, stores and their warehouses,
               and that enabled them to create new customer experiences.

- **Capital One** - used to be a traditional physical bank, but today it is a truly digital bank which has
                    no data centres of their own. They depend on AWS cloud for all of their technology needs.

- **Amazon** - uses multiple digital technologies to support their business transformation. Tech like AI/ML, API, Analytics etc
               are commonly used.

## Continuos Transformation

**Transformation is not a one-time initiative.**

> Continuos change + Adoption of digital technologies

- Businesses need to change on a continuous basis
- Rapid changes are needed in systems and applications
- Organizations need to keep up pace with new and evolving technologies
